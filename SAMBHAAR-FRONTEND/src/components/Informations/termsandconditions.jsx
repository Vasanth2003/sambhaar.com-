              We will deliver the products to the address you provide on the
              platform. You are responsible for providing a complete and correct
              delivery address, along with any necessary delivery instructions.

              Our delivery agents will call on your registered phone number
              while delivering one-time orders. If you ask us to leave a
              delivery unattended at your address, you release us from any
              liability that may arise from the products being left unattended
              for any length of time. This includes risks such as theft,
              tampering, contamination, and changes in temperature for chilled
              or frozen items.

              We charge a very minimal handling fee of ₹50 per delivery only
              when you order is less than the amount of ‘₹500’ for products.

            <li>
              We do not charge any delivery fee for subscriptions (recurring
              orders). For ‘one-time’ orders below ₹500 in value, we charge a
              minimal delivery fee of ₹50. For orders above ₹99 in value, we
              offer free delivery. The Users will be informed about all the
              charges, fees, and costs (including, delivery fee) that may be

              not make the full payment. In such cases, we will treat the order
              as cancelled, and we will not be responsible for any losses or
              damages that may result from the non-delivery. We reserve the
              right to charge you for the delivery fee for such a cancelled
              order and recover the same at our discretion towards the cost
              incurred on such delivery attempt.
