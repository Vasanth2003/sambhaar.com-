              Fruits and Vegetables are natural products that come in different
              shapes, sizes and colour. While we have strict control over the
              average sizes and weights, there is always scope for weight to
              vary from your ordered quantity. As a process, we make sure that
              in all conditions, only a maximum of 100grams can go extra and
              hence you will be charged pro-rata for the additional quantity.
